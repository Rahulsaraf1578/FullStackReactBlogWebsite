I was wrong in above condition you just have to run mongodb server and then run mongo no need to create new database every time.
This is the final version of the project which will not run in desktop. Beacuse at this stage we have made a local database and every time we are downloading it from github that gets deleted so we have to make new.

First run frontend and backend by using following commands

Frontend :- npm start
BackEnd :- npm run dev

Go to backend
1. Run this command in terminal
mongod --dbpath ./{mongodata}/

2. Then in other terminal run
Mongo
